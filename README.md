## The Story When Doing This Challenge
This is my story when building this project. I want to mention that `style-guide.md` doesn't provide the blue color as the active state of the social media icons. So, I used color picker and get this color code `rgb(8, 193, 255)`.

I also used very dark cyan color as my main font color.

### Header
I noticed that the logo and the *try it free* button on mobile design is too small. I made them a little bit bigger. It's also an accessibility part where if your website has buttons, they need to have a decent *touch target*. That way they are easy to click.

## Hero
When I built the hero section, I noticed that `16px` body font size is too big, so I reduced it to `15px`.

### Section
The `section-background` was tricky. After several try and error, I found out that I need to put the `background-image` on the sibling element, not the direct section. 

Let me explain, what's that mean. For example I wanted the first section have `bg-section-top-1` and `bg-section-bottom-2`. I wanted the top one on the top and so the opposite. At first I thought that I need to put those background on its section and then position it using `background-position`.

```css
.section {
  background-image: 
    url("../images/bg-section-top-mobile-1.svg"),
    url("../images/bg-section-bottom-mobile-1.svg")
  ;
  background-position: top, bottom;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
}
```

But it doesn't work, the background images were inside the section. They also were invisible, since I used the same color for background color.

So, I tried to put it on the previous sibling, which was `hero` and it worked!

```css
.hero {
  background-image: 
    url("../images/bg-section-top-mobile-1.svg"),
  ;
  background-position: bottom;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
}
```

For the bottom background image I used the next sibling element.

### Footer

## What I Learned



## Built With
This project is created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**. 

I used one of the form features from [Netlify which Forms Spam Filters](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/spam-filters/), using **Honeypot field**.

I also used [Mailgo](https://mailgo.dev/), which is a light JavaScript library for `mailto` and `tel`. It will give you a nice popup for every `mailto` and `tel` link. I really ‚ù§Ô∏è love this library, since it is **easy** and **simple** to use.
